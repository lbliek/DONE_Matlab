Matlab version

Laurens Bliek & Hans Verstraete, 2015

DONE minimizes a function that may suffer from noise, by approximating the function with a random Fourier expansion.

This implementation is meant to make it as clear as possible what is going on inside the algorithm. This results in a slow implementation. For faster implementations, please see:

* C++: https://bitbucket.org/csi-dcsc/donecpp
* Julia: https://github.com/rdoelman/DONEs.jl
* Python wrapper: https://bitbucket.org/csi-dcsc/pydonec
